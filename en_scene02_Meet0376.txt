"0-376" How about this?

"They gesture to the furnace corridor. A radiant heat rolls over the space."

[0-376] "The incinerator shaft along these corridors are leaking. The sealant is overdue for retrieval from storage."
[0-376] "I’m still waiting on 0-250 and 0-141 to bring the RS-07 compound to me so that it can be fixed."
[0-376] "Why don’t you check up on them and bring the compound to me?"

Objective: Recover RS-07 for containment repair.
Condition: Hazard navigation likely."
