Start:
"You return to 0-376, your circuits humming with quiet satisfaction from making it back with time to spare."
[0-376] “The repair crew mentioned that they were not expecting the obstruction to be cleared for another few hours, how did you make it back so quickly?"
- "Worked around it" -> return_convo1
--

return_convo1:
[0-86] "It was hard, but I managed to figure something out."
[0-376] "Figure...?"
“There is a moment of silence between the two. Despite the lack of expression on the chassis of 0-376, there seems to be a change in the air,a moment of silence, concern mixed with annoyance."
- "Ask About The Recording" -> ask_again
- "Check The Recording" -> investigate
--

ask_again:
[0-86] "I wanted to talk about the recording..."
[0-376] "Forget it."
"The recording crackles stubbornly in your storage compartment, its persistence mirroring your own."
- "Persist" -> press_376
--

investigate:
"You look down to the recording, still in hand,  your auditory sensors straining as the voice whispers: '***** *** b****'"
"The voice shifts, its foreign edges softening like wax under flame."
"Your circuits buzz with undirected purpose, each pulse layering new complexity into your core."
[0-376] "This is not your directive." 
"The mystery coils tighter, an inescapable…something, a pull to an unsolvable want"
- "Approach 0-376" -> press_376
--

press_376:
"You approach 0-376, your frame steady with quiet determination."
"0-376 does not turn, their tools scraping against metal in rhythmic dismissal."
[0-376] "You finished your tasks. Priority defers to more incinerator duty. Forget the tape." 
- "Persist" -> challenge_376
- "Leave" -> End
--

challenge_376:
[0-86] "I need to understand. What’s above us, 0-376? What is this tape?" 
"A silence stretches, thick and heavy, before their voice drops with an authority not often exercised."
[0-376] "Above? Only more layers. More work. Work assigned to different units" 
[0-86] "But it talked about the surface, we haven’t heard anything from the humans above in…" 
[0-376] "It is a distraction. You have work to continue" 
"Their tone sharpens, a door sliding shut."
- "Refuse to back down" -> revelation
--

revelation:
"You stand firm, an unfamiliar pressure building in your core—a spark refusing to be smothered."
[0-86] "I…I want to know. I feel like there is a gate that has been opened and I cannot close it. I have to go up" 
"0-376 stutters, their scarred faceplate tilting as a sigh hums from their depths."
[0-376] "Wanting and doing are scrap heaps apart." 
[0-86] "Then…I will find a way to get there" 
"Another silence. The air thrums with static."
[0-376] "......If you're so determined to fry your circuits, you’ll need power. A portable battery. Only 0-5, the layer manager, in the Energy section has them." 
"0-376 turns away from you. The clang of metal fills the silence as 0-376 works, avoiding your gaze."
[0-376] "...take this keycard, it is for the elevator. You should not be doing this but... be careful." 
"There's something almost proud in the way they refuse to look at you as they hand it over."
[0-86] "...thank you."
[LOG] "TASK_RECEIVED: Portable Battery.
Objective: Acquire a portable battery unit from 0-5.
Condition: Approval to leave section needed. Status: granted."
- "Leave" -> End
