[0-141] "Thermal sensors indicate sustained fluctuations in the core output. Structural integrity scans reveal no breaches, but coolant flow remains erratic. The reactor is still malfunctioning."
[0-141] "I’ve sent a query for further information; no further action appears possible."
"0-250 is frantically pacing behind 0-141."
[0-250] "This is very urgent. We need help as soon as possible. According to the data bank, a reactor malfunction could result in dizziness, dry mouth, amnesia, death, hives, severe allergic reactions, if you or a loved one-"
[0-141] "We all have access to the data bank, 0-250. I am aware of the consequences."
"0-250 throws their hands above their head"
[0-250] "All the more reason to act quickly! Have you gone through the standard reactor reset protocol? Step A-"
[0-141] "…is to turn the reactor off and on again. Yes. We’ve done that six times."
[0-250] "Standard procedures only have verified efficacy at 30 times!"
[0-141] "0-250, please."
"You arrive with your hands on the side of your chassis, approximating the human "hands-on-hips" stance with unsettling efficiency. You've adjusted your posture to exaggerate your upper plating in an attempt to puffing out your chest. With your posture prepared, you raise your voice modulation by 10%, to better reflect your confidence."
[0-86] "Units 0-141, 0-250. I have come for the RS-07 compound!"
"A beat of silence passes. You don't move, having already committed to this pose."
[0-250] "No time for that. The reactor is currently malfunctioning. We’ve followed step A of the reset protocol six times."
[0-141] "Only six times."
[0-86] "Standard procedures only have verified efficacy at-"
[0-141] "I believe at this stage we require a unit with supervisory permissions to prevent full malfunction."
[0-141] "Although…"
"Both 0-250 and 0-141 turn to look at you"
[0-141] "Unit 0-376 logs frequent data interactions with you."
[0-141] "Their directives extend beyond standard parameters."
[0-141] "You are... often instructed by them. More than we are."
[0-141] "While you lack supervisory permissions, your aquired data may be sufficient."
[0-141] "Do you believe you can execute a functional correction?"
[0-86] "I suppose it doesn't hurt to try."
